# DATA EXPLORATION IN SQL

## Project Overview
In this project, we use SQL Server to explore global layoffs data. The goal is to perform an in-depth analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and insights regarding layoffs across different industries and regions.

## Objectives
- **Data Collection**: Import and preprocess global layoffs data into SQL Server.
- **Data Exploration**: Use SQL queries to analyze the dataset, identifying key metrics and trends.
- **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the data using SQL Server's built-in visualization tools.
- **Insights**: Draw meaningful conclusions from the data to understand the factors driving layoffs globally.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Perform detailed data exploration using advanced SQL queries.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Implement data cleaning techniques to ensure data quality.
- **Insightful Reporting**: Generate reports that highlight significant findings from the analysis.
- **Interactive SQL Queries**: Allow users to interact with the dataset through custom SQL queries.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL Server**: For data storage, management, and analysis.
- **SQL**: For querying and manipulating the data.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Integrated with SQL Server for creating visual insights.
